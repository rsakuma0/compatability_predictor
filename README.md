# compatability_predictor
interview project


Input reads from a file.  Run the exe file, "compatabilityPredictor.exe" found in the bin Release folder.
It will start a command line tool with instructions.

The default input file it uses is located in the same dir as the exe file.  Simply press enter to use it.
Or you can type in the path of the file you want to use instead.

After application runs, it will output results to the terminal window and also to a file located in the same dir
as the executable.


If you choose to open and run the application code, user input logic starts in main, while main computation happens in the
compatabilityPredictor class.  In the main function, you can change the computation method used to calculate compatability.
